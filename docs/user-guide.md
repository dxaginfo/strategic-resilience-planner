# Strategic Resilience Planner: User Guide

## Introduction

The Strategic Resilience Planner helps organizations identify dependencies on key assets and develop strategies to mitigate associated risks. This guide will walk you through using the application effectively.

## Getting Started

1. Access the application at [https://dxaginfo.github.io/strategic-resilience-planner/](https://dxaginfo.github.io/strategic-resilience-planner/)
2. No login is required - all data is stored locally in your browser
3. Click "Start New Assessment" on the homepage

## Assessment Wizard

The assessment wizard guides you through a series of steps to evaluate your organization's dependencies and risks.

### Step 1: Organization Profile

- Enter basic information about your organization
- Select your industry sector
- Specify the number of employees/team members
- Define your organization's key objectives

### Step 2: Key Asset Identification

- Add the critical assets your organization depends on
  - Key personnel (star players, executives, specialists)
  - Systems (technologies, platforms, facilities)
  - Relationships (key clients, partnerships, sponsors)
- For each asset, provide a name and category

### Step 3: Dependency Assessment

For each identified asset, rate the following factors:
- **Importance**: How critical is this asset to your operations? (1-10)
- **Replaceability**: How difficult would it be to replace? (1-10)
- **Time to Replace**: How long would replacement take? (days/weeks/months)
- **Concentration Risk**: How concentrated is your dependency? (1-10)

### Step 4: Contingency Evaluation

For each high-dependency asset, assess:
- Current backup/redundancy measures
- Existing knowledge sharing practices
- Cross-training initiatives
- Documentation and processes

### Step 5: Results & Dashboard

After completing the assessment, you'll see:
- Overall Resilience Score
- Dependency Risk Heat Map
- Key Vulnerabilities Analysis
- Recommended Actions

## Using the Dashboard

### Resilience Score

The overall Resilience Score (0-100) indicates your organization's ability to withstand the loss of key assets:
- 0-40: High vulnerability
- 41-70: Moderate resilience
- 71-100: Strong resilience

### Risk Visualization

The dashboard includes several visualization tools:
- **Dependency Heat Map**: Shows which assets pose the greatest risk
- **Impact vs. Probability Matrix**: Plots each dependency by impact and probability
- **Resilience Radar Chart**: Shows strengths and weaknesses across different dimensions

### Recommendations

The system generates tailored recommendations in three categories:
- **Quick Wins**: Immediate actions to reduce critical risks
- **Medium-Term Plans**: Strategic initiatives to implement within 3-6 months
- **Long-Term Strategy**: Fundamental changes to build lasting resilience

## Saving and Sharing Results

- **Save Assessment**: Your assessment is automatically saved in your browser
- **Export Report**: Generate a PDF report of your results
- **Share Link**: Create a shareable link (does not contain your data, only the parameters to recreate it)

## Scenario Planning

Use the Scenario Planning tool to:
1. Model the impact of losing specific assets
2. Test different resilience strategies
3. Compare outcomes across scenarios
4. Identify optimal resource allocation

## Tips for Best Results

- Involve multiple stakeholders in the assessment process
- Be honest in your evaluations - underestimating risks reduces the value of results
- Update your assessment quarterly or after significant organizational changes
- Use the scenario planning feature to prepare for different contingencies
- Implement the highest-priority recommendations first
